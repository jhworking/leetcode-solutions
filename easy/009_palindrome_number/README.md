# Palindrome Number

**Problem:**  
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.  

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same **forward and backward**.

**Example 1:**  
Input: x = 121  
Output: true  
Explanation: 121 reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 2:**  
Input: x = -121  
Output: false  
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**  
Input: x = 10  
Output: false  
Explanation: Reads 10 forward and 01 backward, not the same.

**Constraints:**  
- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it **without converting the integer to a string**?
