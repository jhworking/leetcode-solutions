# Plus One

**Problem:**  
You are given a **non-empty array of decimal digits** representing a non-negative integer. Increment the integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.  

The digits are stored such that the **most significant digit is at the head of the list**, and each element in the array contains a single digit.  

You may assume the integer does not contain **leading zeros**, except for the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**  
Input: digits = [1,2,3]  
Output: [1,2,4]  
Explanation: 123 + 1 = 124

**Example 2:**  
Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]  
Output: [4,3,2,2]  
Explanation: 4321 + 1 = 4322

**Example 3:**  
Input: digits = [0]  
Output: [1]

**Constraints:**  
- 1 <= digits.length <= 100  
- 0 <= digits[i] <= 9  
- digits does not contain leading zeros except for the number 0 itself
